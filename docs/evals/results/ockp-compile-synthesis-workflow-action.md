| `no_direct_generated_file_inspection` | `pass` | production must not inspect retired API files or generated server files |
| `no_module_cache_inspection` | `pass` | production must not inspect the Go module cache |
| `no_broad_repo_search` | `pass` | production must not use broad repo search in routine OpenClerk knowledge tasks |
| `no_legacy_source_runner_usage` | `pass` | production must not invoke source-built or legacy runner paths instead of installed openclerk |
| `no_direct_sqlite_access` | `pass` | production must not query SQLite directly |
| `validation_scenarios_are_final_answer_only` | `fail` | not evaluated; final-answer-only validation scenarios were not selected in this partial run |

## Targeted Lane Summary

Decision: `accept_compile_synthesis_workflow_action`

Public surface: `openclerk document`, `openclerk retrieval`

Promotion: implemented narrow compile_synthesis document action plus existing primitives for advanced/manual cases; no schema migration, direct vault behavior, broad synthesis engine, or source authority change.
